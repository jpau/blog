My name is James, and I help teams create value from data.

I've been fortunate to sit across the data team, in a variety of data science, analytics, leadership, and engineering roles, at firms like [Shippit](https://shippit.com "Shippit"), [me&u](https://me&u.com.au "me&u"), [Uber](https://uber.com "Uber"), [Quantium](https://quantium.com "Quantium"), and [Queensland Treasury](http://treasury.qld.gov.au/ "Queensland Treasury"). 

I'm based in Sydney, Australia and can be reached on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameshpeterson/ "LinkedIn").
