Today's data analysis workflows differ depending on one surprising difference: the language used to interact with data.

It's bizarre that analysis using:

* Procedural languages (Python, R, Julia, ...) resemble lab reports with baked-in code ("notebooks"), whereas 
* SQL analyses instead take an "Etch A Sketch" workflow: write a single query, snapshot it, then erase and start over.

I argue that SQL notebooks will become the norm for analytics.

Notebooks will become the norm for SQL analysis as three things happen:

* SQL notebook offerings improve
* 

Three things about today's SQL analysis experience that suck:

* Analysis workflow (creating new knowledge)
* Knowledge bases (sharing that knowledge)
* Creating engagement (delivering insights that get used)
* Iteratively and efficiently conducting analysis that's clear, repeatable, and extensible
* metrics that engage in the decision-making process.
