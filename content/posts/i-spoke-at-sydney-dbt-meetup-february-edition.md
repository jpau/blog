Yesterday [I spoke at the February 2021 edition of the Sydney dbt meetup](https://youtu.be/ZltzrTGD5Ms?t=223 "YouTube video"), on principles for starting your company's first data capability.

In particular, I spoke about:

* The mindset you need to spread,
* What to do first/second/third, and
* How to prioritise opportunities.

[It's available on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ZltzrTGD5Ms?t=223 "YouTube video"). I start at around 3:45, and am followed by Pip Sidaway's great talk on SQLFluff.
